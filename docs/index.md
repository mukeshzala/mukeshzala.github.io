## AI Engineer & Senior Hands-On Architect

I design and build **production-grade AI systems** that go beyond experimentation—combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Agentic AI**, and **scalable backend APIs** with proven cloud-native engineering practices.

With **10+ years of experience** in enterprise software, I focus on transforming LLM capabilities into **scalable, reliable, and highly available  systems** that solve real business problems.

## What I Build

### 🔹 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* Enterprise knowledge assistants over PDFs, APIs, and internal systems
* Embedding strategies, chunking trade-offs, and vector search optimization
* Grounded responses with citations and hallucination controls

### 🔹 Agentic AI Systems

* Tool-using agents with planning, memory, and structured workflows
* Multi-agent systems for analysis, automation, and decision support
* Practical agent design focused on control, safety, and debuggability

### 🔹 Backend APIs for AI

* Cloud-native APIs that operationalize LLM workloads
* Event-driven and asynchronous microservices
* Observability-first design for AI systems in production

## How I Approach AI Engineering

I approach AI engineering with the same rigor as distributed systems:

* **Architecture first** — clear boundaries, responsibilities, and failure modes
* **Evaluation matters** — accuracy, latency, cost, and consistency are measurable
* **Observability built-in** — AI systems must be traceable and debuggable
* **Production mindset** — notebooks evolve into services, pipelines, and platforms

AI doesn’t remove the need for engineering discipline—it **raises the bar**.

## Experience Snapshot

* **Principal Software Engineer – Dell Technologies**
  Designing and supporting large-scale, cloud-native systems used in production environments.

* **Background across**
  Cloud platforms, microservices, event-driven architectures, reliability engineering, and observability.

* **AI & ML Education**
  Post Graduate Program in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**
  (The University of Texas at Austin)

This blend allows me to bridge **AI innovation** with **enterprise reality**.

## AI Engineer | Senior Hands-On Architect

I have completed formal education in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** from **The University of Texas at Austin** and am currently focused on **learning, experimenting, and building AI systems** to deepen my practical understanding.

This site serves as a **technical workspace** where I explore modern AI patterns, document design decisions, and build real systems—ranging from **RAG-based applications** and **Agentic AI workflows** to **backend APIs that support LLM-driven use cases**.

The emphasis here is on **hands-on learning, system thinking, and sharing insights** with the broader AI and open-source community.

## Purpose of This Site

It exists to:

* Apply AI/ML concepts through real implementations
* Explore strengths and limitations of LLM-based systems
* Document architectural trade-offs and engineering decisions
* Share experiments and learnings openly

I treat AI systems the same way I treat distributed systems:
they must be **understood, observable, and explainable**.

## Areas of Exploration

### 🔹 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* Knowledge-driven AI over documents, APIs, and structured data
* Experimentation with chunking strategies and embedding models
* Techniques for grounding responses and reducing hallucinations

### 🔹 Agentic AI

* Tool-using agents with planning, memory, and control flow
* Single-agent and multi-agent experiments
* Applying agents to real analytical and automation tasks

### 🔹 Backend APIs for AI Systems

* Cloud-native APIs that expose and orchestrate LLM capabilities
* Event-driven and asynchronous service patterns
* Designing AI systems with reliability and observability in mind

## How I Work

My approach is iterative and systems-oriented:

* Start with fundamentals and theory
* Build focused experiments and prototypes
* Evolve promising ideas into structured systems
* Measure behavior, performance, and cost
* Document findings and lessons learned

This approach helps bridge **formal education** with **practical engineering insight**.

## 📖 Project Description

The **TEKS Math AI Tutor** is designed to answer Grade 5 mathematics questions using **only official TEKS curriculum content**.

### Key Capabilities

- Retrieves relevant TEKS standards from a **vector database**
- Uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** with retrieved context
- Produces responses in a **strict JSON schema**
- Prevents hallucinations by disallowing non-curriculum knowledge

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 🔹 High-Level Flow

1. TEKS Grade 5 Math document ingestion  
2. Text cleaning and chunking  
3. Embedding generation  
4. Vector database creation  
5. Query-time retrieval (Top-K relevant chunks)  
6. Prompt + retrieved context sent to LLM  
7. Structured JSON response returned

## 📚 Knowledge Base

- **Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) – Grade 5 Mathematics**
- Curriculum text is chunked and embedded
- Each response references a relevant TEKS standard

### Scope Restriction
- Grade 5 Math only  
- No external knowledge  

---

## 📓 Jupyter Notebook Workflow

The ![Jupyter Notebook](/src/backend/Grade5_Math_Project.ipynb) includes:

- TEKS document loading
- Text preprocessing and chunking
- Embedding creation
- Vector store initialization
- Prompt engineering
- RAG-based question answering tests

The notebook was used to validate the pipeline before Hugging Face deployment.

                "CorrectAnswer": {"type": "string"}
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }

```

## ACCURACY / ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:
Do the math carefully. Ensure only one correct option unless the user explicitly asks for multiple correct answers.
If you detect ambiguity (missing numbers/units), ask ONE clarifying question using: {"type":"Concept","message":"I need one detail to answer: ..."} (Keep it math-only and kid-safe.)

STYLE GUIDELINES:
 - Use simple words and short sentences for kids.
 - For parents/teachers, add a brief note on how to support learning (1–2 sentences).
 - Avoid unrelated topics, brand names, or personal data requests.

## 🚀 Future Scope & Enhancements

This project is designed with extensibility in mind. The following enhancements outline the planned roadmap to evolve the TEKS Math AI Tutor into a scalable, multi-grade educational platform.

---

### 🔮 Functional Enhancements

- **User Authentication & Activity Tracking**  
  Introduce secure user authentication (e.g., OAuth or token-based login) to identify users uniquely and maintain session-level context.  
  This will enable:
  - User-specific interaction history
  - Learning progress tracking
  - Personalized tutoring experiences

- **Multi-Grade & Multi-Subject Expansion**  
  Extend the current Grade 5 Math–only scope to support:
  - Additional grades (Grades 1–12)
  - Multiple subjects (Science, English, Social Studies, etc.)  
  Each grade and subject will have isolated curriculum ingestion and retrieval pipelines to preserve accuracy.

- **Enhanced User Interface (UI/UX)**  
  Develop a richer and more interactive frontend with:
  - Chat-based tutoring interface
  - Visual explanations (charts, diagrams)
  - Improved accessibility and mobile responsiveness

- **User Subscription & Interest-Based Notifications**  
  Implement a subscription module allowing users to:
  - Select preferred grades and subjects
  - Subscribe to specific topics or skill areas  

  The system will periodically generate and send **relevant practice questions, quizzes, or learning tips** to users via email based on their preferences.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Enhancements

### 🔹 Retrieval Quality Dependence  Add structured logging across the system, including:
  - The quality of generated answers is **highly dependent on the retriever**.
  - If relevant curriculum chunks are not retrieved (due to embedding similarity errors or suboptimal chunking), the LLM may produce:
  - Incomplete explanations
  - Overly generic responses
- There is no secondary validation or reranking mechanism in place.

---

### 🔹 Limited Context Window

- Only a **fixed number of top-K retrieved chunks** are passed to the LLM.
- Important curriculum details may be omitted if they fall outside the retrieved context.
- This can impact answers for:
  - Multi-step problems
  - Broad or cross-topic questions

### 🔹 Limited Personalization

- The current architecture does not maintain:
  - User memory
  - Learning history
  - Skill progression
- All users receive the same responses for identical queries, regardless of prior interactions.

---

### 🔹 No Answer Verification Layer

- Generated responses are not validated against:
  - Rule-based checks
  - Mathematical solvers
  - Ground-truth answer keys
- Although curriculum grounding reduces hallucinations, **absolute correctness is not guaranteed**.

---


- **Scalable Knowledge Management in Vector Database**  
  Enhance the vector database design to:
  - Store embeddings segmented by **grade, subject, and curriculum**
  - Dynamically load and query the appropriate knowledge base at runtime
  - Support efficient scaling as new curricula are added  

  This modular approach will enable seamless expansion without impacting existing grade-level accuracy.

---

These enhancements aim to transform the project from a single-grade RAG demo into a **full-scale, curriculum-aware AI tutoring platform** suitable for real-world educational deployment.

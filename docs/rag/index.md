# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

This section groups my work on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**—
with an emphasis on **grounded, constrained, and explainable AI systems**.

Rather than treating RAG as a single pattern, I explore it as a design space
involving trade-offs across retrieval quality, chunking strategy,
embedding selection, and context management.

## Focus Areas

- Curriculum- and domain-grounded retrieval
- Anti-hallucination techniques
- Schema-enforced responses
- Vector database design
- Prompt and retrieval orchestration

## RAG Projects

### 📘 TEKS Math AI Tutor – Grade 5
**Curriculum-grounded RAG system aligned with official TEKS standards**

- Scope-restricted knowledge base
- Strict JSON response schema
- Designed to prevent non-curriculum hallucinations

Future RAG projects will continue to build on these patterns and learnings.
